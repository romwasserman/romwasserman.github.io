# About myself!

I was born in May 22nd 1999, in Tel Aviv, Israel.

I have been playing soccer since I was 6 years old. I have been playing in Maccabi Tel Aviv, which considered the best soccer club in Israel until I was 18. When I reached 18 I moved to Hapoel Ramat Gan which played in the first division for U20.

I served in the Israeli army for 2 years in an air force intelligence unit.

I came to Quinnipiac to pursue my dream to be a professional soccer player, as I am playing for the men's soccer team here, and at the same time to earn a degree in a high level learning area.

I like to play sports with friends and family, play video games, read books, and go to the beach. I like nature and archaeology. My family and I travel all around the world!

# About my family!

I have 2 siblings. My older brother, Oran, is 25 and currently lives in Logan, Utah. He is graduating this year, studying food science and chemistry, and being a student athlete (hammer throw). My younger brother, Liram, is 19 and currently serving in the Israeli army in a combat unit.

We have 2 dogs, Fibi, and Boni. We rescued Fibi from a shelter around 8 years ago, and we adopted Boni 3 years ago. I am deeply connected with my dogs, especially with Boni, and can't wait to see them again in few months! Hopefully we are going to adopt another dog this summer!


That is it about my family and I!
