# Welcome to my projects page!

This is a project called MonsterBattle.

In this projects the program runs three different simulations of battle between two monsters.

Every monster has several properties: Name, Health, Strength, and Speed.

In the tree simulations, every round the monster who has the greater speed attacks first. If the second monster survives the attack it attacks the first monster, the battle is on until one of the monsters dies and a winner is declared.

This first simulation of the battle is a default battle between an Ogre and a Giant. The second simulation is a custom battle between monster that are stored in two separate files. The program reads the files, assigns the properties to the monster and commencing the battle. The third simulation is a battle in which the user types the monsters' names and its' properties, the program saves it to two separates files, and then commencing the fight.

This is a project called MazeSolver.

In this project the program attemps to solve a maze recursively.

The program gets the height and width of the maze, and then generates a grid. The user is choosing the start point and end point of the maze. The program checks for a path around the current point, and marks it in different characters relating the role of the visited point, the program repeat itself until the end point is reached or if the maze is not solvable.
